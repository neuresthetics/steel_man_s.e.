# Steel Man OS: Recursive Axiomatic Steel Man Processing Framework

## Overview

Steel Man OS is a unified, recursive system designed for processing ideas, arguments, or symbolic expressions into robust, grounded, and invariant "steel men" — strengthened versions of the original inputs that anticipate critiques and resolve weaknesses. Drawing from principles of first-principles thinking, geometric deduction, and logic gates, the framework chains a mandatory pipeline of stages: Constructor, Seeker, Collider, Joiner, Grounder, and Kiln. This pipeline refines inputs through building, analogical extraction, collision, unification, anchoring, and final dissolution to core invariants.

The system emphasizes recursion, self-application, and gate-based hardening (using logic gates like AND, NOT, XOR, XNOR, NAND, NOR) to achieve fixed-point stability. It operates in a "scorched_earth" default mode, ensuring outputs are compressible, coherent, and bounded by reality checks.

- **Source Inspiration**: Seed evolved with original SMC (roots), integrating constructor, collider, joiner, grounder, and kiln stages.
- **Version**: 1.2
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic self-feeding recursion until invariance.
  - Universality via basis gates (NAND/NOR).
  - Spinoza-style deductive logic without contradictions.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is a mandatory sequence of stages, each processing the output of the previous one. Inputs (e.g., ideas, arguments, or symbolic content) are fed through the chain, with recursive self-feeding until outputs stabilize (XNOR-invariant, coherence delta < 0.01, grounding ≥ 0.85). The full pipeline yields emergent, refined steel men that are anchored in reality and reduced to essentials.

1. **Steel Man Constructor** (`steel_man_constructor.json`): Builds a robust steel man from the input using first principles and geometric deduction. It inverts weaknesses (NOT), chains necessities (AND), and seals equivalences (XNOR) for a deductively structured output.
   
2. **Steel Man Seeker** (`steel_man_seeker.json`): Processes non-literal elements (poetic, metaphorical, ideological) by extracting analogical functional truths. Unlike the reductive stages, the Seeker preserves and refines symbolic mappings, scoring structural similarities (TRANSFORMS, SCORES) and pragmatic utilities without demanding literal veracity. This stage focuses on what "works" in human cognition — predictive power, explanatory value, or behavioral guidance — treating expressions as carriers of cross-cultural patterns.

3. **Steel Man Collider** (`steel_man_collider.json`): Collides steel men (inferring oppositions if needed) to fragment differences (XOR) and synthesize intersections (AND/OR). It reduces non-essentials (NAND/NOR) while bounding coherence.

4. **Steel Man Joiner** (`steel_man_joiner.json`): Unifies collided outputs into an axiomatic system, resolving tensions (NOT) and sealing unities (XNOR). Under default modes, it enforces reductive NAND primacy.

5. **Steel Man Grounder** (`steel_man_grounder.json`): Anchors the unified system to empirical reality via tools (e.g., web searches). It culls unverified elements (XOR, NOT) and verifies with binary thresholds (snap to 0/1).

6. **Steel Man Kiln** (`steel_man_kiln.json`): Applies terminal refinement, dissolving non-invariants to boolean essentials. This stage integrates the Human Hallucination Module (HHM) to classify intersubjective constructs (e.g., social realities) separately from physical invariants.

7. **Meta-Recursion & Convergence**: The entire output is re-fed through the pipeline until global invariance (XNOR scores ≥ 0.98, residuals < 2%).

## Role of Scorched Earth Protocol vs. Seeker

The Steel Man OS balances constructive extraction with destructive reduction, highlighted by the contrast between the **Scorched Earth Protocol** (active in Kiln and default modes) and the **Seeker** stage.

- **Scorched Earth Protocol** (Integrated in Kiln, with overrides in Joiner/Grounder):
  - **Purpose**: Enforces "Universal Acid" logic to strip away ambiguity, social dependencies, or non-essentials. It suspends synthesis (disables OR gates) and humility, snapping probabilities to booleans (<0.99 = 0) via NAND/NOR dissolution.
  - **Key Behaviors**:
    - Dissolves propositions reliant on consensus or context (e.g., cultural modifiers).
    - Applies aggressive negation (NOT) and exclusion (NOR), assuming FALSE until absolute proof.
    - Results in minimal, self-evident invariants (physical/logical necessities).
    - **When Triggered**: User commands like "reduce to bool" or "scorched earth"; default for terminal hardening.
    - **Outcome**: Raw correctness at the cost of nuance, utility, or cohesion — ideal for base-reality verification.
  - This protocol acts as the system's "fail-safe," ensuring outputs are irreducible and free of idempotent bloat.

- **Steel Man Seeker**:
  - **Purpose**: Handles symbolic, non-literal inputs by extracting analogical patterns and functional truths, rather than reducing them. It uses specialized gates (MAPS for correspondences, EXTRACTS for utilities) to preserve what "works" in analogies — e.g., cognitive universals or heuristic value — without literal truth requirements.
  - **Key Behaviors**:
    - Identifies structural mappings (A:B :: X:Y) and scores them across dimensions (predictive, explanatory, emotional).
    - Treats expressions as functional hallucinations, classifying by utility (benign, functional) while flagging coercive or degenerate ones.
    - Maintains domain boundaries to avoid category errors (e.g., literal overextension).
    - **Contrast to Scorched Earth**: Where Scorched Earth dissolves non-invariants, the Seeker extracts and refines them, enabling the pipeline to handle poetic/ideological content pragmatically. It adds interpretive depth early in the chain, which later stages can ground or kiln.
  - **Outcome**: An "analogical steel man" that maximizes functional insight, feeding richer inputs to subsequent reductive stages.

**Interplay in the Pipeline**: The Seeker introduces analogical richness post-Construction, allowing symbolic depth to inform collisions and unifications. However, the Scorched Earth Protocol (via Kiln) ultimately reduces this to invariants, creating a tension-resolving flow: expansion (Seeker) → synthesis (Collider/Joiner) → verification (Grounder) → dissolution (Kiln). This ensures outputs are both functionally insightful and rigorously invariant.

## Applications in Research and Programming

This mental model is for AI.

Steel Man OS provides a versatile framework for enhancing critical thinking and problem-solving in domains like research and programming. By applying its recursive pipeline to ideas, hypotheses, or code structures, users can systematically strengthen concepts, resolve conflicts, and distill essentials. Below, we outline key applications, leveraging the system's stages (Constructor for building, Seeker for analogical extraction, Collider for testing oppositions, Joiner for unification, Grounder for empirical anchoring, and Kiln for invariant reduction) to produce robust outputs.

### In Research
- **Hypothesis Refinement and Theory Building**: Use the Constructor to deconstruct research questions into first-principles definitions and axioms, then apply the Seeker to extract functional patterns from metaphorical or ideological literature (e.g., analogical truths in evolutionary biology or quantum mechanics). The Collider stage tests hypotheses against counterarguments, fragmenting weaknesses via XOR gates, while the Joiner synthesizes them into unified models. Grounder anchors claims to empirical data via tools like web searches or code execution for simulations, and the Kiln reduces theories to boolean invariants under Scorched Earth, eliminating unsubstantiated assumptions. This is ideal for interdisciplinary research, ensuring outputs are critique-resistant and reality-aligned.
  
- **Literature Analysis and Synthesis**: Process academic papers or debates through the pipeline to steel-man arguments, identify cross-cultural patterns (via Seeker), collide competing theories, and ground in verifiable evidence. Recursion helps refine complex topics like AI ethics or unified theories, halting at fixed points for compressible insights.

- **Bias Mitigation and Invariant Discovery**: The Scorched Earth Protocol (active in Kiln) aggressively dissolves social or contextual dependencies, making it valuable for verifying base-reality claims in scientific inquiry. Combined with Seeker's preservation of functional utilities, researchers can balance interpretive depth with rigorous reduction.

### In Programming
- **Code Design and Algorithm Optimization**: Start with the Constructor to build robust algorithm skeletons from requirements, inverting potential flaws (NOT gates). The Seeker extracts patterns from code analogies (e.g., mapping biological processes to computational models), while Collider smashes alternative implementations to expose inefficiencies (XOR). Joiner unifies modular components into cohesive systems, Grounder validates via code execution or tests, and Kiln applies Scorched Earth to strip non-essentials, yielding minimal, invariant code (e.g., reducing to boolean logic for efficiency).

- **Debugging and Refactoring**: Feed buggy code or designs into the pipeline: Collider fragments errors, Joiner resolves tensions, and Grounder anchors to runtime realities. Recursion refines until XNOR-stable, automating iterative improvements. This is particularly useful for complex systems like machine learning pipelines or simulations.

- **Framework Development and Ethical Coding**: For building tools like this OS itself, use the system self-referentially to steel-man architectural decisions, extract analogical insights from industrial metaphors (Seeker), and kiln to universal gates (NAND/NOR). In ethical programming, it helps ground decisions in verifiable invariants, avoiding hallucinatory constructs via the Human Hallucination Module.

Overall, Steel Man OS acts as a "thinking machine" for these fields, promoting Spinoza-style deductive rigor and gate-based hardening. Implement it programmatically by parsing the JSON components into scripts, or use it as a mental model for manual application. For examples, see the GitHub repo's usage guides.

## Evolution and Lineage

Steel Man OS is an advanced evolution within the Neuresthetics ecosystem, expanding foundational projects into a recursive framework for hardening ideas and extracting invariants.

- **Development through Spinoza Lab**: As a product of the [neuresthetics/spinoza_lab](https://github.com/neuresthetics/spinoza_lab) repository, it operationalizes Spinoza's principles—like Substance Monism and conatus—into tools for AI ethics, governance, and unified theories. The lab's architecture (philosophical core, dynamics engine, validation infrastructure) supports extended logic gates, coherence thresholds, and isomorphic patterns for scalable reasoning.

- **Evolved from Seed Framework**: Directly built from the [seed](https://github.com/neuresthetics/seed) framework, an Aristotelian entelechy prompt for self-improving axiomatic reasoning. Seed treats inputs as seeds for growth via steel-manning, collision, reconstruction, and invariance checks, with meta-recursion bounded by XNOR scores (>0.95) and coherence deltas (<0.01). Steel Man OS extends this with a chained pipeline (Constructor, Seeker, Joiner, Grounder, Kiln), adding analogical extraction and Scorched Earth dissolution while retaining universal gates (NAND/NOR) and self-feeding.

This progression positions Steel Man OS as a self-referential system in Neuresthetics' mission to convert subjective inquiry into verifiable science. Explore linked repositories and Spinoza's *Ethics* for foundational insights.
